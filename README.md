# 2019-Poverty-Report-
Poverty, the state of living without sufficient income to provide for one’s needs (or one’s family’s needs), is a globally recognized issue (United Nations, n.d.). In the United States, several social assistance programs exist to address the US’s War on Poverty, first declared in 1964 by the Johnson Administration. Since 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau has annually published The American Community Survey (ACS) Supplemental Poverty Measure (SMP), which provides a detailed snapshot of poverty with consideration of government programs designed to respond to poverty (Census Bureau, October 2021). Our goal is to analyze the 2019 ACS SMP’s report on poverty and the respected supplemental poverty programs (Census Bureau, October 2021).

The goal will be achieved by framing the project to answer the following questions:
    1.	What is the magnitude of aid that supplemental poverty programs provide? 
    2.	Are federal poverty relief programs statistically effective at increasing resources for impoverished people?
